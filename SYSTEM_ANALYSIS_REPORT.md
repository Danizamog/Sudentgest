#### ⚠️ Teacher Limitations

##### 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE #1: Cannot Create Courses
**Problem:**
- Teachers can only be assigned to existing courses
- Only Directors can create courses (`CourseController.create_course` checks for `Director` role)
- Backend: `back/Courses/controllers/course_controller.py` line 49-66

**Impact:** Teachers cannot create their own courses

**Recommendation:** 
- ✅ **Keep as is** - This is actually correct behavior. Directors should manage course creation for institutional control.
- Alternative: Allow teachers to "propose" courses for director approval

##### 🟡 ISSUE #2: Cannot Enroll Students
**Problem:**
- Only Directors can enroll students in courses
- Backend: `CourseController.enroll_course` requires `Director` role (line 99-135)
- Teachers cannot add students to their courses

**Impact:** 
- Teachers must request directors to enroll students
- No self-service course registration

**Recommendation:**
- 🔧 **FIX NEEDED:** Allow teachers to enroll students in courses they teach
- Add check: `if user_rol not in ["Director", "admin"] and not is_teacher_of_course(user_id, curso_id)`

##### 🟡 ISSUE #3: Cannot View All Students in Course Details
**Problem:**
- CourseDetail.vue only accessible to Directors (no visible route for teachers)
- Teachers need to see enrolled students for attendance and grading
- Current workaround: Students appear in attendance/grading interfaces

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ Already working through grading interface
- Consider: Add explicit "View Course Roster" button in teacher view

#### 📊 Teacher Flow: **90% COMPLETE** ⚠️
**Blockers:**
1. Cannot enroll students in their courses (needs director)
2. Limited course management capabilities

---

### 3. 🏛️ DIRECTOR (Director) Flow

#### ✅ Available Features

1. **Director Dashboard** ✅
   - Location: `/director-dashboard` → `DirectorDashboard.vue`
   - Status: ✅ COMPLETE

2. **User Management Panel** ✅
   - Location: `/director` → `DirectorPanel.vue`
   - Backend: Director service (port 5012)
   - Features:
     - ✅ View all users (students, teachers, directors)
     - ✅ Create new users (with auto-generated passwords)
     - ✅ Edit user information
     - ✅ Delete users
     - ✅ Filter by role
     - ✅ Search by name/email
   - Status: ✅ COMPLETE

3. **Database Management** ✅
   - Location: `/base` → `BD.vue`
   - Status: ✅ COMPLETE

4. **View Reports** ✅
   - Location: `/director-reports` → `DirectorReports.vue`
   - Backend: Reports service
   - Status: ✅ COMPLETE

5. **Manage Excuses** ✅
   - Location: `/excuses/manage` → `ExcusesManagement.vue`
   - Features: Approve/reject student excuses
   - Status: ✅ COMPLETE

#### ⚠️ Director Gaps

##### 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE #4: Cannot Manage Course-Student Assignments
**Problem:**
- Directors can create courses ✅
- Directors can create students ✅
- BUT: No dedicated interface to bulk-enroll students in courses
- Current method: Must use CourseDetail view (accessed through Courses page)

**Impact:**
- Cumbersome workflow for enrolling multiple students
- No bulk enrollment feature
- Must enroll students one-by-one

**Current Workflow:**
1. Go to `/courses`
2. Click on a course
3. Click "Ver" button → Goes to `/courses/:id` (CourseDetail)
4. View enrolled students
5. Manually enroll one student at a time

**Recommendation:**
- 🔧 **HIGH PRIORITY FIX:**
  1. Add "Gestión de Inscripciones" section to Director sidebar
  2. Create new view: `CourseEnrollmentManagement.vue`
  3. Features:
     - Select course from dropdown
     - Multi-select students to enroll
     - Bulk enrollment action
     - View all enrollments by course or student
     - Unenroll students (currently requires CourseDetail view)

##### 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUE #5: Cannot Assign Teachers to Courses
**Problem:**
- Courses have `profesor_id` field in database
- Backend has `assign_teacher` endpoint: `POST /api/courses/{curso_id}/assign-teacher`
- BUT: No frontend interface to assign teachers

**Current Workaround:**
- Teachers can only be assigned through CourseDetail view
- Location: CourseDetail.vue has "Asignar Profesor" modal
- But this requires navigating to individual course details

**Impact:**
- Directors cannot easily assign teachers to courses
- No bulk teacher assignment
- Hidden feature (exists in backend but not easily accessible)

**Recommendation:**
- 🔧 **HIGH PRIORITY FIX:**
  1. In Courses.vue (Director view), add "Asignar Profesor" button to each course card
  2. Modal to select professor from dropdown
  3. Call backend: `POST /api/courses/{curso_id}/assign-teacher`
  4. Alternative: Add to Course creation form

##### 🟡 ISSUE #6: Course Management UI Needs Enhancement
**Problem:**
- Directors can create courses ✅
- Directors can edit courses ✅
- Directors can delete courses ✅
- BUT: No overview of course assignments (which teachers teach what, how many students per course)

**Recommendation:**
- 🔧 **MEDIUM PRIORITY:** 
  1. Add statistics to Courses.vue cards:
     - "Profesor: [Name]" or "Sin profesor"
     - "X estudiantes inscritos"
  2. Quick actions on each card:
     - Assign/Change Teacher
     - View Enrollments
     - Manage Course

#### 📊 Director Flow: **75% COMPLETE** ⚠️
**Blockers:**
1. No bulk student enrollment interface
2. Teacher assignment hidden in CourseDetail
3. Missing course management overview

## 📝 Tareas (Assignments) Service Deep Dive

### Current Implementation (C# - Program.cs)
**Status:** ⚠️ **FUNCTIONAL but OVER-ENGINEERED**

### Features Available
1. ✅ Create assignments (teachers)
2. ✅ View assignments by course
3. ✅ Mark assignments as complete (students)
4. ✅ View completion statistics (teachers)
5. ✅ Multi-tenant support (UCB, UPB, Gmail)

### Frontend Integration
- ✅ AssignmentsView.vue fully functional
- ✅ Accessible from course detail pages
- ✅ Role-based: Teachers create, students complete
- ✅ Real-time statistics

### 🔴 Issues Found in Tareas Service

#### ISSUE #7: Inconsistent Implementation
**Problem:**
- Tareas service is in C# (Program.cs - 1052 lines!)
- All other services (Courses, Attendance, Director, Grades) are in Python/FastAPI
- Creates maintenance complexity
- Different patterns, different dependencies

**Recommendation:**
- 🔧 **LOW PRIORITY (but consider for future):**
  - Rewrite Tareas in Python/FastAPI for consistency
  - Benefits: Unified codebase, easier maintenance, same patterns
  - Current: Works fine, not urgent

#### ISSUE #8: Missing Assignment Features
**Current Features:**
- ✅ Basic assignment creation
- ✅ Completion tracking
- ❌ File uploads (students submit files)
- ❌ Grading assignments (teachers grade submissions)
- ❌ Comments/feedback on assignments
- ❌ Assignment types differentiation (task, exam, project)
- ❌ Due date notifications

**Recommendation:**
- 🔧 **MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
  1. Add file upload support (Supabase Storage)
  2. Add grading capability (integrate with Grades service)
  3. Add comments/feedback field
  4. The `assignment_type` field exists but not fully utilized

#### ISSUE #9: Duplicate Logic with Grades
**Problem:**
- Assignments can have `points` field
- But grading is done separately in Grades service
- No integration between assignment completion and grade registration

**Recommendation:**
- 🔧 **MEDIUM PRIORITY:**
  - When teacher grades an assignment, automatically register in Grades service
  - Link assignment points to grade weights (parciales)

if not user_data or user_data.get("rol") not in ["Director", "admin"]:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="No tienes permisos para inscribir")

# NEW:
user_rol = user_data.get("rol", "").lower()
if user_rol not in ["director", "admin"]:
    # Check if user is teacher of this course
    curso_data = await get_course_by_id(schema, enrollment.curso_id)
    if not curso_data or curso_data.get("profesor_id") != user_data["id"]:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=403, 
            detail="Solo puedes inscribir estudiantes en tus propios cursos"
        )
```

### 2. Add Course Statistics Endpoint
**File:** `back/Courses/routes/course_routes.py`  
**Add new endpoint:**
```python
@router.get("/{curso_id}/stats")
async def get_course_stats(curso_id: int, authorization: str = Header(None)):
    """Get course statistics (enrollments, teacher, etc.)"""
    user = await get_current_user(authorization)
    return await CourseController.get_course_stats(curso_id, user["email"])
```

### 3. Create Bulk Enrollment Endpoint
**File:** `back/Courses/routes/course_routes.py`  
**Add new endpoint:**
```python
@router.post("/bulk-enroll")
async def bulk_enroll(
    enrollments: List[CourseEnrollment], 
    authorization: str = Header(None)
):
    """Bulk enroll multiple students (Directors only)"""
    user = await get_current_user(authorization)
    return await CourseController.bulk_enroll(enrollments, user["email"])
```
